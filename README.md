Todo APP is a command-line tool that empowers you to efficiently manage your tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface to add, view, edit, and complete tasks, making it easy to stay organized and on top of your goals.

## Installation

### 1. Building from Source

-   Clone the Repository:

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:frangdelsolar/todo_cli.git
```

-   Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
    cd todo_cli
```

### Customization (Optional)

-   For a more convenient experience, consider adding an alias to your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc). This allows you to run todo commands directly from any directory:

```bash
    # In your shell configuration file
    todo() {
        cd <path/to/todo_app>  # Replace with the actual path to your Todo APP directory
        go run . "$@"
    }
```

**Note**: Replace <path/to/todo_app> with the actual directory where you cloned the repository or built the executable.
